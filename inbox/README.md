# Ni-Al Interatomic-Potential Benchmark

## Current project record

This repository contains a completed static, zero-temperature benchmark of a pretrained MACE model and three classical Ni-Al embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials. It is not a MACE fine-tuning project yet: no project-specific MACE training, DFT calculations, molecular dynamics, or OVITO analysis has been run.

The completed calculation sequence is:

1. ASE environment and a small FCC-Al MACE sanity check.
2. Acquisition and deterministic selection of five Ni-Al crystal structures from Materials Project.
3. MACE zero-shot single-point calculations.
4. MACE fixed-cell and full-cell relaxations.
5. MACE-consistent Al and Ni reference relaxations and formation energies.
6. Comparison with Materials Project processed DFT-derived data.
7. Selection and benchmarking of three published Ni-Al EAM potentials in LAMMPS.

The detailed, audited numerical record is in [RESULTS_SUMMARY.md](RESULTS_SUMMARY.md). [PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md](PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md) explains the workflow and interpretation, while [Show_Case.md](Show_Case.md) presents the extended comparison.

## Models used

| Role | Model or system | How it was used |
|---|---|---|
| Machine-learning potential | **MACE-MP-0 Small** | Pretrained, zero-shot potential; CPU; float64 for Steps 5-8. The Step 3 FCC-Al sanity check used float32. No fine-tuning was performed. |
| Classical potential | **Purja Pun-Mishin (2009) Ni-Al EAM** | `eam/alloy` in LAMMPS; primary general-binary EAM baseline. |
| Classical potential | **Mishin (2004) Ni-Al EAM, ipr2** | `eam/alloy` in LAMMPS; the corrected `ipr2` implementation was used. |
| Classical potential | **Mishin-Mehl-Papaconstantopoulos (2002) B2-NiAl EAM** | `eam/alloy` in LAMMPS; historical B2-focused baseline. |
| Reference data | **Materials Project processed DFT-derived values** | Benchmark only; database version `2026.04.13`, resolved to `GGA_GGA+U_R2SCAN` for all five compounds. These values are not experimental truth and were not used as MACE elemental reference energies. |

**Primary model used by this project:** MACE-MP-0 Small, a pretrained universal MACE interatomic potential. It was evaluated directly; it was not trained or fine-tuned on this repository's Ni-Al structures.

## Systems evaluated

| System | Materials Project ID | Structure | Atoms in calculated cell | Use |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Al | `mp-134` | FCC, Fm-3m (225) | 1 | MACE and EAM elemental reference |
| Ni | `mp-23` | FCC, Fm-3m (225) | 1 | MACE and EAM elemental reference |
| Al3Ni | `mp-622209` | Pnma (62) | 16 | MACE and EAM compound benchmark |
| Al3Ni2 | `mp-1057` | P-3m1 (164) | 5 | MACE and EAM compound benchmark |
| AlNi | `mp-1487` | Pm-3m (221) | 2 | MACE and EAM compound benchmark |
| Al3Ni5 | `mp-16514` | Cmmm (65) | 8 | MACE and EAM compound benchmark |
| AlNi3 | `mp-2593` | Pm-3m (221) | 4 | MACE and EAM compound benchmark |

Nine exact-composition Materials Project candidates were retained. The five systems above were selected reproducibly by the documented ranking rule; the four alternative polymorphs remain in `data/raw/`.

## Main completed results

All five MACE full-cell relaxations converged safely and preserved the detected starting symmetry. MACE formation energies use independently relaxed MACE elemental references:

`mu_Al = -3.709587940 eV/atom` and `mu_Ni = -5.732347320 eV/atom`.

| Phase | MP processed DFT formation energy | MACE full-cell formation energy | MACE signed error | MACE volume error |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Al3Ni | -0.418776 | -0.460362 | -0.041587 | +2.7397% |
| Al3Ni2 | -0.644217 | -0.641073 | +0.003143 | +2.3826% |
| AlNi | -0.684901 | -0.690231 | -0.005330 | +2.6282% |
| Al3Ni5 | -0.563251 | -0.606098 | -0.042847 | +3.2800% |
| AlNi3 | -0.426420 | -0.488036 | -0.061616 | +2.8941% |

Energies are in eV/atom. Signed error is `method - MP processed DFT`.

| Method | Formation-energy MAE | RMSE | Pairwise ordering agreement | Volume MAE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **MACE-MP-0 Small** | **0.030905** | **0.038471** | **10/10** | 2.7849% |
| Purja Pun-Mishin 2009 EAM | 0.117265 | 0.153381 | 8/10 | 1.8576% |
| Mishin 2004 EAM (ipr2) | 0.126620 | 0.159870 | 8/10 | 2.6759% |
| Mishin 2002 EAM | 0.149494 | 0.166682 | 8/10 | **1.6380%** |

On this five-compound static benchmark, MACE-MP-0 Small has the lowest formation-energy MAE and reproduces the Materials Project ordering exactly. It is not the best method on every individual phase: Purja Pun-Mishin 2009 is best for Al3Ni5 and Mishin 2004 ipr2 is best for AlNi3. These five compounds are not a complete Ni-Al phase diagram.

## Calculation software and recorded execution settings

| Item | Recorded setting |
|---|---|
| MACE calculations | CPU, float64, dispersion disabled (Steps 5-8); FIRE optimiser |
| MACE relaxation thresholds | max force <= 0.01 eV/Angstrom; full-cell max absolute ASE stress <= 0.0006241509 eV/Angstrom^3 |
| Fixed-cell / full-cell MACE limits | 500 / 1000 optimiser steps |
| LAMMPS | `22 Jul 2025 - Update 4`; `eam/alloy`; `metal` units; periodic boundaries; conjugate-gradient minimisation |
| LAMMPS benchmark matrix | 3 potentials x 7 systems x 3 states = 63 calculations; 63 completed; 0 failures |
| Environment snapshots | `mace-torch==0.3.16`, `ase==3.29.0`, `torch==2.13.0+cpu`; see `environment/requirements_step*_final.txt` |

The result artifacts record CPU execution, but do not preserve a CPU model, memory size, operating-system edition, CUDA version, or GPU configuration. Those unrecorded details are deliberately not inferred here.

## Reproducibility and result locations

The source configurations are in `configs/`; input structures and their provenance are under `data/`; scripts are in `scripts/`; calculations and reports are under `results/`.

Key authoritative outputs:

No calculation was rerun while updating this documentation. The values above were transcribed from the completed, versioned result artifacts during a documentation audit on 2026-08-19.

## Scope limits and next research stage

The benchmark covers static bulk cells only. It does not establish accuracy for defects, interfaces, surfaces, finite-temperature properties, dynamical stability, or long molecular-dynamics trajectories. Nickel magnetism is an additional limitation: the structural MACE workflow has no user-controlled spin or magnetic-moment input.

The documented next stage is a controlled Ni-Al DFT reference-data campaign with convergence and magnetic-state checks. Fine-tuning should be considered only after that dataset is validated.

## Historical README preserved verbatim

The section below is retained from the repository revision before the 2026-08-19 documentation audit. The current project record above and [RESULTS_SUMMARY.md](RESULTS_SUMMARY.md) take precedence where historical planning text differs from the completed calculation record.

"# NiAl_MACE" 
# Ni–Al MACE Interatomic Potential Project

## Project Overview

This project investigates the use of a universal pretrained MACE interatomic potential for Ni–Al alloy systems.

The main goal is to evaluate the pretrained model on Ni–Al structures and then fine-tune it using consistent reference data. The fine-tuned model will be evaluated using machine-learning error metrics and physical validation tests before being used in molecular dynamics simulations.

## Research Question

Can a universal pretrained MACE model be fine-tuned to provide accurate and physically reliable predictions for Ni–Al alloy structures?

## Main Objectives

1. Evaluate a universal MACE model on Ni–Al structures before fine-tuning.
2. Prepare and validate a consistent Ni–Al reference dataset.
3. Fine-tune the selected MACE foundation model.
4. Evaluate energy, force, and stress predictions on unseen structures.
5. Validate important physical properties of Ni, Al, and Ni–Al phases.
6. Integrate the final model with LAMMPS for molecular dynamics simulations.
7. Visualize and analyze the simulation outputs using OVITO.

## Proposed Comparison

The project will compare:

* Reference calculations.
* The universal MACE model before fine-tuning.
* The Ni–Al fine-tuned MACE model.
* A traditional interatomic potential when an appropriate baseline is available.

## Project Workflow

1. Define the research question and scope.
2. Prepare the software environment.
3. Create basic Ni and Al structures.
4. Test the universal MACE baseline.
5. Collect and inspect reference data.
6. Convert the data into a consistent training format.
7. Create training, validation, and test splits.
8. Fine-tune the MACE model.
9. Evaluate machine-learning accuracy.
10. Validate physical properties.
11. Run molecular dynamics simulations.
12. Analyze results and document conclusions.

## Current Status

### Step 0 — Project Definition

Status: Completed

Completed tasks:

* Defined the initial research goal.
* Defined the initial research question.
* Selected Ni–Al as the target alloy system.
* Selected MACE as the machine-learning interatomic potential framework.
* Defined the initial comparison between the universal and fine-tuned models.

### Step 1 — Project and Environment Setup

Status: In Progress

Current tasks:

* Create the project directory.
* Create the standard folder structure.
* Initialize the Git repository.
* Record the computer and software information.
* Prepare an isolated Python environment.

## Important Scientific Principle

A low machine-learning error alone does not prove that an interatomic potential is physically reliable.

The model must also be tested on structures and physical conditions that were not used during training. Physical properties and molecular dynamics stability must be evaluated separately.

## Change Log

### 2026-07-16

* Created the initial project structure.
* Added the research question and objectives.
* Added the proposed workflow.
* Added data management and reproducibility rules.
* Started the environment setup stage.
### Python Environment

- Project Python version: Python 3.11.9
- Virtual environment: `.venv`
- Active interpreter:

## Step 2 – Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)

Status: Completed

Completed tasks:

- Installed ASE successfully.
- Verified ASE can generate FCC aluminum structures.
- Confirmed atomic positions and simulation cell can be created.
- Prepared the project for integration with MACE.

Lessons learned:

- ASE is not a physics engine.
- ASE is a framework that creates and manipulates atomic structures.
- ASE will become the interface between Python, MACE, and LAMMPS.

## Step 2 — Atomic Simulation Environment

Status: Completed

### Completed Tasks

* Installed the Atomic Simulation Environment.
* Verified that ASE can generate an FCC aluminum crystal.
* Generated the primitive FCC unit cell using a lattice constant of 4.05 Å.
* Confirmed that the primitive cell contains one aluminum atom.
* Confirmed that ASE correctly represents periodic cell vectors and atomic positions.

### ASE Test Result

The generated aluminum structure had:

* Chemical formula: Al
* Number of atoms: 1
* Crystal type: FCC primitive cell
* Lattice constant: 4.05 Å
* Periodic boundary representation: three-dimensional periodic cell

### Interpretation

The single atom does not represent the full aluminum crystal. It represents one primitive periodic cell that is repeated in three dimensions.

ASE will be used as the structure and calculator interface between Python, MACE, Materials Project data, and LAMMPS.

## Planned Data Source

Materials Project will be used to obtain Ni, Al, and Ni–Al structures and calculated properties.

The project will initially use Materials Project data for:

* Selecting relevant Ni–Al phases.
* Obtaining relaxed crystal structures.
* Recording material identifiers and calculation provenance.
* Comparing lattice, energy, formation-energy, and stability results.
* Investigating relaxation trajectories as a possible source of training configurations.

Materials Project summary data alone will not automatically be treated as a complete MACE training dataset. Each candidate training configuration must be checked for consistent energy, atomic-force, stress, structure, and DFT-method information.

Mixing data generated using different DFT functionals will be avoided unless the difference is explicitly understood and handled.

## Current Status

### Step 2 — Atomic Simulation Environment

Status: Completed

### Step 3 — MACE Installation and Baseline Testing

Status: Ready to Begin

### ASE Validation Result

The ASE validation script successfully created a primitive FCC aluminum cell.

Recorded results:

- Chemical formula: Al
- Number of atoms: 1
- Atomic number: 13
- Lattice constant: 4.05 Å
- Primitive-cell volume: 16.607531 Å³
- Periodic boundaries: enabled in all three dimensions

The calculated primitive-cell volume is consistent with an FCC conventional
cell containing four atoms. This confirms that ASE generated the expected
primitive aluminum structure correctly.

## Step 3 — MACE Aluminum Baseline

Status: Completed

### Execution Environment

- Python version: 3.11.9
- Python environment: `.venv`
- Execution device: CPU
- Foundation model: MACE-MP-0 small
- Numerical precision: float32
- Dispersion correction: disabled

### Evaluated System

A 2 × 2 × 2 conventional FCC aluminum supercell was generated using ASE.

- Number of atoms: 32
- Initial lattice constant: 4.05 Å
- First structure: perfect FCC aluminum
- Second structure: one atom displaced by 0.05 Å along the x direction

### Baseline Results

#### Perfect FCC Aluminum

- Total energy: -118.70617676 eV
- Energy per atom: -3.70956802 eV/atom
- Maximum force: 0.00000245 eV/Å
- Mean force: 0.00000140 eV/Å

#### Displaced FCC Aluminum

- Total energy: -118.70216370 eV
- Energy per atom: -3.70944262 eV/atom
- Maximum force: 0.16058496 eV/Å
- Mean force: 0.01531472 eV/Å

### Comparison

Moving one atom by 0.05 Å increased the predicted energy by:

- 0.00401306 eV

The perfect periodic crystal produced forces close to zero. The displaced
structure produced a clear increase in force and energy. This confirms that
the pretrained MACE model responds to changes in the local atomic environment.

This test validates the software workflow only. It does not yet establish
the final physical accuracy of the model.

## Step 4 — Ni-Al Phase Structure Acquisition

Status: Completed on 2026-07-20. The authenticated Materials Project
acquisition retained nine exact-composition candidates and selected one
working structure for each of the five target phases.

### Purpose and Scientific Scope

This step prepares a reproducible, provenance-rich structure dataset from
Materials Project. It downloads crystal structures and summary metadata only;
it does not train or fine-tune MACE, relax structures, run molecular dynamics,
or perform EAM, MEAM, or LAMMPS calculations.

The five target intermetallic compositions are:

* `Al3Ni`
* `Al3Ni2`
* `AlNi` / `NiAl`
* `Al3Ni5` / `Ni5Al3`
* `AlNi3` / `Ni3Al`

The pretrained MACE-MP-0 model already supports both Al and Ni. Pure aluminum
and pure nickel are therefore not being trained separately before the
compounds are studied. They may be introduced later as elemental reference
structures for formation-energy calculations, but they are not part of this
download step.

Materials Project summary structures are not automatically a force-training
trajectory dataset. A summary structure does not by itself provide the
consistent collection of energies, atomic forces, stresses, configurations,
and calculation settings needed for force training.

### Candidate Preservation and Selection

The acquisition script queries all current, non-deprecated summary entries for
each configured formula. It uses pymatgen compositions to verify the exact
reduced composition instead of relying on formula-string order. Every exact
candidate is preserved under `data/raw/`; alternative polymorphs are never
silently discarded.

One candidate is copied to the selected working directory using this
deterministic order:

1. Lowest available energy above hull.
2. Stable entries before entries not marked stable when hull energies tie.
3. Lowest available formation energy per atom when the earlier values tie.
4. Lexicographical Materials Project ID as the final tie-breaker.

Missing numerical values rank as positive infinity. The selected candidate is
the project's reproducible current working structure, not a claim of absolute
experimental ground truth. The manifest and metadata record the full ranking
and a human-readable selection reason.

### API-Key Security and Installation

Install only the Step 4 packages into the existing project environment from
Windows CMD:

```bat
cd /d D:\Materials_Research\NiAl_MACE
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install mp-api python-dotenv
```

Create the local API configuration and run validation before downloading:

```bat
cd /d D:\Materials_Research\NiAl_MACE
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
copy .env.example .env
python scripts\fetch_ni_al_structures.py --validate-only
python scripts\fetch_ni_al_structures.py
```

Edit `.env` locally and replace the example value with a Materials Project API
key. The script also accepts `MP_API_KEY` when it is already defined as a
Windows environment variable. It never prints the key. **The `.env` file must
never be committed.** `.env.example` contains only a safe placeholder.

To download one phase only:

```bat
python scripts\fetch_ni_al_structures.py --phase AlNi
```

To replace existing downloaded phase files after reviewing the consequences:

```bat
python scripts\fetch_ni_al_structures.py --overwrite
```

Without `--overwrite`, an existing complete candidate bundle causes a clear
failure rather than an implicit replacement. An incomplete bundle always
stops the workflow with a partial-output diagnostic so its provenance can be
inspected before another acquisition is attempted. During an explicit
`--overwrite` refresh, candidate bundles no longer returned by the current API
query are reported and removed in the same rollback-protected transaction that
publishes the replacement files and manifests.

### Output Layout

Directories are created only by a real successful acquisition when needed:

```text
configs/
└── ni_al_phases.json
data/
├── raw/materials_project/ni_al/
│   └── <phase_key>/<material_id>/
│       ├── structure.cif
│       ├── structure.extxyz
│       └── metadata.json
└── processed/ni_al_structures/
    ├── selected/
    │   ├── Al3Ni.cif
    │   ├── Al3Ni.extxyz
    │   ├── Al3Ni.metadata.json
    │   └── ... corresponding files for all five phases
    ├── ni_al_phase_manifest.csv
    └── ni_al_phase_manifest.json
```

Each candidate has one record in both manifests. Records contain composition,
energetic and symmetry fields when available, selection rank and reason,
retrieval time, and repository-relative raw and selected paths. A single-phase
run merges its new records with existing records for other phases instead of
erasing them.

### Success Criteria and Current Project Status

Step 4 acquisition is complete when all five formulas have been queried, all
exact-composition candidates and provenance metadata have been saved, exactly
one working candidate per phase has been selected deterministically, both
manifests agree, and the console reports zero failed phases.

The code, configuration, API-key safeguards, and validation path are
implemented. The authenticated acquisition completed successfully: nine raw
candidates were retained, five working structures were selected, and the JSON
and CSV manifests record their provenance and deterministic rankings.

### Next Step

The selected Ni-Al structures will be evaluated using the pretrained
MACE-MP-0 small model in a zero-shot single-point baseline before any
fine-tuning decision is made.

## Step 5 — MACE-MP-0 Zero-Shot Evaluation of Ni-Al Phases

Status: Completed on 2026-07-21. Validation passed, the cached pretrained model
loaded successfully, and all five requested phases completed with zero failures.

### Scientific Purpose and Scope

Step 5 tests whether the pretrained MACE-MP-0 small foundation model can
successfully calculate finite energies, forces, and stresses for the five
selected Ni-Al intermetallic structures without additional training. This is a
zero-shot software and physical-response baseline, not yet a complete accuracy
validation against DFT or experiment.

Zero-shot evaluation means that the pretrained model is applied directly to
the selected structures without project-specific training or fine-tuning. The
model is not trained or fine-tuned in this step. Atomic positions, cell vectors,
chemical species, and periodic boundary conditions are preserved exactly as
downloaded, and no geometry optimization or relaxation is performed.

The default calculation settings are:

* Foundation model: MACE-MP-0 small.
* Execution device: CPU.
* Numerical precision: float64.
* Dispersion correction: disabled.
* Evaluation type: zero-shot single-point calculation.

The evaluated phases, in report order, are:

1. `Al3Ni`
2. `Al3Ni2`
3. `AlNi`
4. `Al3Ni5`
5. `AlNi3`

### Calculated Properties and Interpretation

For each phase, the script calculates the total energy, energy per atom,
atomic force vectors, periodic-cell stress, cell volume, and volume per atom.
It also reports the maximum, mean, root-mean-square, and minimum magnitudes of
the per-atom force vectors, together with the vector sum of all atomic forces
and the norm of that total-force vector. The RMS statistic is
`sqrt(mean(|F_i|^2))`, where `|F_i|` is the magnitude of one atom's force.

Stress is reported in the ASE Voigt component order `xx, yy, zz, yz, xz, xy`
in eV/angstrom^3. ASE uses positive stress for tension; hydrostatic compression
has negative diagonal stress components under this convention.

Materials Project formation energies must not be compared directly with raw
MACE total energies in this step. The two sources may use different elemental
energy references and calculation conventions. Step 5 therefore does not
calculate formation energies or subtract elemental reference energies.

The selected Materials Project structures were optimized on a DFT energy
surface, not on the MACE energy surface. Nonzero MACE forces are consequently
expected in general and do not by themselves show that either a structure or
the model is incorrect. A maximum force from this single-point calculation is
not sufficient to classify a phase as physically stable or unstable.

### Inputs and Generated Outputs

The input directory is:

```text
data/processed/ni_al_structures/selected/
```

Original selected files are read only. Annotated copies and summaries are
written under:

```text
results/mace_zero_shot/
├── structures/
│   ├── Al3Ni_mace_zero_shot.extxyz
│   ├── Al3Ni2_mace_zero_shot.extxyz
│   ├── AlNi_mace_zero_shot.extxyz
│   ├── Al3Ni5_mace_zero_shot.extxyz
│   └── AlNi3_mace_zero_shot.extxyz
├── tables/
│   ├── ni_al_mace_zero_shot.csv
│   └── ni_al_mace_zero_shot.json
└── reports/
    └── ni_al_mace_zero_shot.txt
```

Each annotated EXTXYZ retains the source structure and adds explicitly named
MACE energy, force, and stress fields plus model and provenance metadata. The
original Materials Project selected structures are never overwritten.

### Windows CMD Commands

Activate the existing project environment and validate all dependencies,
configuration fields, selected structures, formulas, and output paths without
loading the pretrained model:

```bat
cd /d D:\Materials_Research\NiAl_MACE
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

python scripts\evaluate_ni_al_mace_zero_shot.py --validate-only
```

Run the complete five-phase zero-shot calculation:

```bat
python scripts\evaluate_ni_al_mace_zero_shot.py
```

Evaluate one phase only:

```bat
python scripts\evaluate_ni_al_mace_zero_shot.py --phase AlNi
```

Replace an existing, reviewed Step 5 result bundle:

```bat
python scripts\evaluate_ni_al_mace_zero_shot.py --overwrite
```

### Success Criteria and Current Project Status

Step 5 succeeds when configuration and input validation pass, the pretrained
model loads once, all requested phases return finite energy, force, stress, and
derived statistics, every annotated structure passes read-back verification,
the CSV, JSON, and text reports are published atomically, and the console
reports zero failed phases. Validation-only mode must not load the model, run a
calculation, or create result directories.

Current project status: the Step 5 implementation, configuration,
documentation, environment snapshot, five annotated structures, and three
summary reports are present. The CPU/float64 MACE-MP-0 small run completed all
five phases successfully. The authoritative execution record is
`results/mace_zero_shot/reports/ni_al_mace_zero_shot.txt`.

### Next Step

Reviewing the zero-shot results and preparing controlled geometry-relaxation
tests before comparing MACE with selected Ni-Al potentials in LAMMPS.

## Step 6A — Geometry-Relaxation Configuration and Validation

Status: Completed on 2026-07-22. The relaxation design, selected structures,
metadata, Step 5 baseline, and planned output paths have been validated for all
five phases. No relaxation or new scientific calculation was run.

### …3509 tokens truncated…SHA-256, file
size, and modification-time checks. All sources are rechecked after the fourth
calculation and again inside the publication transaction.

Run the preserved load-only gate, a remaining-phase smoke test, and the batch:

```bat
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\reproduce_ni_al_mace_baseline.py --load-only
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\reproduce_ni_al_mace_baseline.py --phase Al3Ni
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\reproduce_ni_al_mace_baseline.py --all-remaining
```

Without `--overwrite`, every existing target is listed and nothing is
published. After inspection, intentional replacement is limited to Step 6B.3
outputs:

```bat
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\reproduce_ni_al_mace_baseline.py --all-remaining --overwrite
```

All batch artifacts are staged and verified before transactional publication.
If publication fails, the prior complete target set is restored; incomplete
rollback retains a reported recovery directory instead of discarding the only
backup.

### Verified Results and Outputs

| Phase | Reproduced total energy (eV) | Energy difference (eV) | Maximum-force difference (eV/angstrom) | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Al3Ni | -74.695710878699174 | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| Al3Ni2 | -25.78055209010038 | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| Al3Ni5 | -44.56807607688442 | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| AlNi3 | -22.836292364226455 | 0 | 0 | PASS |

All 18 comparison entries per phase passed: the 17 numerical comparisons had
zero absolute difference, and the exact material-ID comparison passed. Four
phases completed, zero failed, all structural and source checks passed, and the
overall Step 6B.3 status is PASS. This establishes computational reproducibility
only; it is not evidence of agreement with DFT or experiment and the raw MACE
energies are not a physical-stability ranking.

The atomically published outputs are:

No optimizer was imported or created, FIRE was not executed, no relaxation
occurred, no positions or cells changed, and no trajectory or structure was
written.

### Success Criteria

Step 6B.3 succeeds only if the batch requests exactly four non-AlNi phases,
loads one calculator, completes exactly four single points, passes every
identity and numerical comparison, passes every in-memory and source-file
immutability check, leaves the protected AlNi report unchanged, and
transactionally publishes all six Step 6B.3 artifacts. The verified run met
every criterion.

### Next Sub-step

Step 6C.1 — Design and validate the atomic-only relaxation runner without executing relaxation.

<!-- NI_AL_STEP6_C_TO_F_START -->
## Step 6C - Atomic-Only Relaxation

The atomic-only runner starts each phase from its original selected EXTXYZ and uses FIRE with a fixed cell. It records step-0 and per-step energy, forces, stress, volume, and periodic displacement. Al3Ni is the pilot. Cells and volumes are immutable at `atol=1e-12, rtol=0`; convergence requires `max_force <= 0.01 eV/angstrom`, and the displacement safety limit is 2 A. After the pilot passes, the other four independent inputs run sequentially through the same one-load calculator session. Initially converged inputs are recorded as `ALREADY_CONVERGED`.

Implementation: `scripts/run_ni_al_mace_atomic_relaxation.py`, with shared validation/publication helpers in `scripts/step6_utils.py` and settings in `configs/mace_relaxation.json`. Outputs are under `results/mace_relaxation/atomic_only/{structures,trajectories,tables,reports,checkpoints,logs}/`; per-step history CSVs are in `tables/`.

## Step 6D - Full-Cell Relaxation

The full-cell runner independently rereads each original structure. FIRE operates on `FrechetCellFilter`; convergence requires both `max_force <= 0.01 eV/angstrom` and raw ASE `max_abs_stress <= 0.0006241509 eV/angstrom^3`. AlNi is the pilot. After it passes, the other four original inputs run sequentially through that mode's same one-load calculator session. Safety checks cover nonfinite values, identity and PBC preservation, positive cells, a 25% absolute volume-change limit, and a 2 A internal-motion limit.

Implementation: `scripts/run_ni_al_mace_full_cell_relaxation.py`, again using `scripts/step6_utils.py` and `configs/mace_relaxation.json`. Outputs are under `results/mace_relaxation/full_cell/{structures,trajectories,tables,reports,checkpoints,logs}/`; per-step history CSVs are in `tables/`.

## Step 6E - Relaxation Comparison

The no-MACE analyzer (`scripts/analyze_ni_al_mace_relaxation.py`) compares Step 5, fixed-cell, and full-cell values; evaluates symmetry with `symprec=0.001 A` and a 5-degree angle tolerance; and writes the comparison tables, report, and nine history/summary figures under `results/mace_relaxation/comparison/`.

| Phase | Atomic status | Atomic steps | Atomic Delta E (eV) | Full-cell status | Full steps | Full Delta E (eV) | Delta V (%) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Al3Ni | CONVERGED | 28 | -0.03974671177 | CONVERGED | 40 | -0.1145317471 | 2.7396658 |
| Al3Ni2 | CONVERGED | 10 | -0.001103025753 | CONVERGED | 33 | -0.01827268287 | 2.3826129 |
| AlNi | ALREADY_CONVERGED | 0 | 0 | CONVERGED | 5 | -0.008715574573 | 2.6281714 |
| Al3Ni5 | CONVERGED | 24 | -0.003624474698 | CONVERGED | 34 | -0.07120490603 | 3.2800406 |
| AlNi3 | ALREADY_CONVERGED | 0 | 0 | CONVERGED | 14 | -0.02247959088 | 2.8941496 |

Raw energies are never used to rank different compositions and no formation energies are calculated.

## Step 6F - Step 6 Completion

Actual overall status: **SUCCESS**. Collision protection rejects existing Step 6C-F bundles unless intentional overwrite is selected; resume reuses only complete bundles that pass provenance, hashes, geometry, convergence, and safety validation.

The orchestrator is `scripts/run_step6_pipeline.py`; the authoritative completion report is `results/mace_relaxation/comparison/reports/ni_al_step6_final_report.txt`. The comparison output tree contains `figures/`, `tables/`, and `reports/`.

These are MACE-potential results, not DFT or experimental validation. The exact next stage is:

Step 7 - Calculate consistent pure Al and pure Ni MACE reference states, then calculate MACE-consistent Ni-Al formation energies.

Step 7 is not implemented here.
<!-- NI_AL_STEP6_C_TO_F_END -->

<!-- NI_AL_STEP7_START -->
## Step 7 - MACE Elemental References and Formation Energies

Step 7 retrieves the stable FCC pure Al and pure Ni reference structures from Materials Project (structures and provenance only - never DFT energies), relaxes both independently with the exact Step 6 full-cell criteria (FIRE + FrechetCellFilter; max force <= 0.01 eV/angstrom; max |raw ASE stress| <= 0.0006241509 eV/angstrom^3; up to 1000 steps), and defines the chemical potentials `mu_X_MACE = relaxed total energy / atoms`.

Selected structures - Al: mp-134, Ni: mp-23. Materials Project database version: Al=2026.04.13; Ni=2026.04.13.

The MACE-consistent formation energy per atom is

```text
E_f = (E_compound_total - N_Al*mu_Al_MACE - N_Ni*mu_Ni_MACE) / (N_Al + N_Ni)
```

applied with the actual cell composition (validated against the formula-unit route at 1e-12 eV/atom). The primary result uses full-cell relaxed compound and elemental energies; the clearly separated diagnostic uses initial fixed-geometry single points on both sides. Initial and relaxed states are never mixed.

Chemical potentials (this executed run): mu_Al_MACE = -3.709587940 eV/atom; mu_Ni_MACE = -5.732347320 eV/atom.

| Phase | x_Ni | Initial E_f (eV/atom) | Relaxed E_f (eV/atom) | Relaxation effect (eV/atom) | Above envelope (eV/atom) | On envelope |

The selected-set lower convex envelope uses only pure Al, the five selected compounds, and pure Ni. It is not the complete Ni-Al convex hull, not Materials Project energy above hull, and not a phase-diagram or experimental-stability claim. Untested compositions may lie below it. Ni is magnetic in DFT descriptions; the structural MACE workflow has no explicit spin input, so the Ni reference is MACE-consistent, not a controlled magnetic DFT reference.

Actual overall Step 7 status: **SUCCESS**. These are MACE-consistent results only; no DFT was performed, no MACE-versus-DFT formation-energy comparison was made, and no accuracy or fine-tuning conclusion is drawn. The exact next stage is:

Step 8 - Select and document candidate classical Ni-Al interatomic potentials for the future LAMMPS comparison.

Step 8 is not implemented here.
<!-- NI_AL_STEP7_END -->

<!-- NI_AL_STEP8_START -->
## Step 8 - MACE vs Materials Project DFT Benchmark

Step 8 retrieves the five selected phases by exact material ID from the official Materials Project summary endpoint and benchmarks the Step 7 relaxed MACE formation energies and Step 6 MACE-relaxed structures against the MP processed DFT-derived references. Processed `formation_energy_per_atom` is used because it is Materials Project's recommended, correction-consistent thermodynamic quantity; raw MACE and VASP total energies use incompatible reference scales and are never compared. The signed error is `MACE - MP DFT` in eV/atom.

Material IDs: Al3Ni=mp-622209, Al3Ni2=mp-1057, AlNi=mp-1487, Al3Ni5=mp-16514, AlNi3=mp-2593. Materials Project database version: 2026.04.13.

| Phase | MP DFT E_f (eV/atom) | MACE relaxed E_f (eV/atom) | Signed error (eV/atom) | MP hull (eV/atom) | dV/atom (%) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Al3Ni | -0.418776 | -0.460362 | -0.041587 | 0.000000 | +2.7397 |
| Al3Ni2 | -0.644217 | -0.641073 | +0.003143 | 0.000000 | +2.3826 |
| AlNi | -0.684901 | -0.690231 | -0.005330 | 0.000000 | +2.6282 |
| Al3Ni5 | -0.563251 | -0.606098 | -0.042847 | 0.000000 | +3.2800 |
| AlNi3 | -0.426420 | -0.488036 | -0.061616 | 0.000000 | +2.8941 |

Aggregate (n=5): MAE = 0.030905 eV/atom; RMSE = 0.038471 eV/atom; mean signed error = -0.029647 eV/atom; exact ranking agreement = True; pairwise ordering agreement = 10/10. Volume: mean signed error = +2.7849%; symmetry agreement = 5/5 (symprec 0.001 A, angle tolerance 5 deg).

MP energy above hull is DFT context computed against the full MP Ni-Al entry set; it is not comparable to and was never subtracted from the Step 7 selected-set envelope. Five phases are a small sample: statistics are descriptive, correlations exploratory, and no universal MACE accuracy claim is made.

Actual overall Step 8 status: **SUCCESS**. No DFT was run, no LAMMPS or fine-tuning was implemented, and no automatic fine-tuning decision was made. The exact next stage is:

Step 9 - Select and document candidate classical Ni-Al interatomic potentials and design the LAMMPS comparison.

Step 9 is not implemented here.
<!-- NI_AL_STEP8_END -->

<!-- NI_AL_STEP9_START -->
## Step 9 - Classical Ni-Al Potential Selection

Step 9 selected, retrieved, and validated three documented binary Ni-Al EAM potentials from the NIST Interatomic Potentials Repository (HTTPS-only, redirect-confined, fingerprinted) and designed the Step 10 LAMMPS benchmark. No LAMMPS simulation, MACE calculation, or DFT calculation was executed, and no new scientific energy exists from this step.

| Candidate | Role | Official file | Cutoff (A) | File element order | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|

| mishin_2002 | historical_secondary | `NiAl02.eam.alloy` | 5.9541 | Ni Al | `68de13eb1b6682bf...` |

**Primary: `pun_mishin_2009`** (Purja Pun & Mishin 2009, DOI 10.1080/14786430903258184) - binary Ni-Al specific, built on established pure-element descriptions with the cross interaction fitted to B2-NiAl properties and ab initio intermetallic formation energies. Secondary: `mishin_2004_ipr2` (gamma/gamma-prime focus) - only the corrected ipr2 file `NiAl_Mishin_2004.eam.alloy` is accepted because the superseded ipr1 file has non-zero isolated-atom energies, while ipr2 sets F(rho=0)=0. Historical secondary: `mishin_2002` (B2-optimized; documented pure-element weakness).

All files are `eam/alloy` setfl files validated array-by-array (headers, Al+Ni identity, grids, finiteness, exact counts, no trailing content) with byte-identical processed copies under `data/processed/interatomic_potentials/ni_al/`. Planned mapping: atom type 1 = Al, type 2 = Ni via `pair_coeff * * <file> Al Ni` (never per-pair pair_coeff and never pair_style hybrid mixing).

Local LAMMPS availability: **AVAILABLE_AND_EAM_ALLOY_CONFIRMED** - 'C:\Users\A\AppData\Local\LAMMPS 64-bit 22Jul2025 with Python\bin\lmp.EXE -h' completed; eam/alloy was listed in the help output. LAMMPS was not installed automatically; absence only affects Step 10 readiness.

The Step 10 design (results/lammps_potential_selection/plans/) specifies: identical starting structures for every potential; two-stage static minimization (fixed-cell, then full-cell via `fix box/relax` at zero pressure); per-potential elemental references with the standard formation-energy equation; force target 0.01 eV/angstrom and stress target 0.0006241509 eV/angstrom^3 = 999.999988 bar (converted from exact SI definitions); and independent convergence verification.

Actual overall Step 9 status: **SUCCESS**. The exact next stage is:

Step 10 - Execute the designed LAMMPS benchmark: convert structures, relax with each validated classical potential, and compare formation energies and structures against MACE and the Materials Project DFT references.

Step 10 is not implemented here.
<!-- NI_AL_STEP9_END -->

<!-- NI_AL_STEP10_START -->
## Step 10 - LAMMPS Classical-Potential Benchmark

Step 10 executed the Step 9-designed static benchmark: the three validated NIST EAM/alloy potentials each processed independent copies of the same seven original selected structures (pure Al, pure Ni, five compounds) through an initial `run 0`, a fixed-cell CG minimization, and a full-cell `fix box/relax tri 0.0` minimization (63 states total; sequential; no dynamics, velocities, or thermostats). Convergence was verified independently: max force <= 0.01 eV/angstrom and max |pressure component| <= 999.999988 bar (= 0.0006241509 eV/angstrom^3; stress = -pressure/1.602176634e6). Formation energies use each potential's own relaxed pure-element references in the matching state; no cross-potential, MACE, or MP elemental reference was ever mixed.

| Method | MAE (eV/atom) | RMSE (eV/atom) | Mean signed (eV/atom) | Ranking exact | Volume MAE (%) | Symmetry |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---:|---|
| MACE-MP-0 Small | 0.030905 | 0.038471 | -0.029647 | True | 2.7849 | 5/5 |

| Mishin 2002 EAM | 0.149494 | 0.166682 | +0.149494 | False | 1.6380 | 5/5 |

Best method by formation-energy MAE: **MACE-MP-0 Small**. Full per-phase values, envelopes, runtime, and structural details are under `results/lammps_benchmark/`; the authoritative report is `results/lammps_benchmark/reports/ni_al_step10_final_report.txt`.

Actual overall Step 10 status: **SUCCESS**. These are static bulk-phase results only; they do not prove accuracy for defects, surfaces, interfaces, finite temperature, or dynamics, and no potential is universally best. The exact next stage is:

Step 11 - Design and generate a DFT reference dataset for Ni-Al, beginning with convergence tests and pilot calculations.

Step 11 is not implemented here.
